# Background jobs in Java Spring Boot API

This repository shows a codebase for a Java Spring Boot API that uses CompletableFutures to run background jobs. The jobs aren't all run asynchoronously, however, they are run suquentially via CompletableFuture.thenApply() method.

This repo also maintains a queue of running jobs.
